# DocuSign Driver for the ElectronicSignature Library (not public yet)


This is using the https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel foundation.

The goal is by using the included https://github.com/docusign/docusign-esign-php-client 

Have the main class `src/DocusignDriver.php` 100% working

There are notes above every function there to help

I will share a video shortly of DocuSeals code since the goal is 100% the same.

## Upload the Template to Docusign

This video shows how I did it with DocuSeal and I am hoping you can find a way to do this in DocuSign

>NOTE: Download the video so it is not sideways ðŸ¤¦
